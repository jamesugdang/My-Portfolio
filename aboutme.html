            <h4>About Me</h4>
            I am James Ugdang, an aspiring software tester currently enrolled in the Information Technology: Quality Assurance program at NBCC. I am set to graduate in June. I was inspired to become a Software Tester because I was driven by a passion for ensuring seamless user experiences and delivering high-quality software. I was a former Quality Manager in Data Annotation at Scale, a company that focused on developing high-quality Self-Driving Cars. Still, now I have changed my career to Software Testing to broaden my knowledge of Software and apply my experience in a more engaging and impactful way.
